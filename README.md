# Frekwencja CCWE

This repository contains the code for frekwencja.ccwe.pl service that was deployed prior to app's shutdown somewhere near the end of the year 2020. It has been uploaded as a curiosity and to provide some transparency for the app.

# Getting it working

The project wasn't intended to do run on its own, but here are some steps to help you out anyway:

- remove ".example" from the frontend config file name
- replace all ocurrences of URLs pointing to our servers with your own
- optionally, un-Lambdify backend code (it's an AWS Lambda function)
